# Practicum project portfolio

This repository contains projects completed as a part of the Practicum Data Analyst certification.

Each folder represents a separate project and contains a detailed README file describing the project, the full project notebook, the dataset(s), and any other elements that may have been included in the project (such as dashboards or presentations).


| Project Name | Description | Libraries |
|---|---|---|
|[Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/shirarua/practicum-projects/tree/main/preprocessing-project) | Introductory project focused on data cleaning, in which features are explored to determine what may impact the probability of customers defaulting on a loan.| *Pandas, matplotlib, nltk, sidetable*|
|[Video Game Trends](https://github.com/shirarua/practicum-projects/tree/main/videogame_sales_trends)| Analyzed online sales of video games to identify regional industry trends to make recommendations for allocation of future marketing costs.| *Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sidetable, scipy.stats*|
|[Cafe Market Research](https://github.com/shirarua/practicum-projects/tree/main/market_research)| Explored features of current Los Angeles eateries to understand how a proposed robot-run café will fit in the current market. |*Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express, re, sidetable*|
|[Sales Funnel AAB Testing](https://github.com/shirarua/practicum-projects/tree/main/sales_funnel_AAB)| Analyzed the results of an AAB test exploring the effect of a font change on customer progression through the sales funnel on a food delivery app. |*Pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, datetime, sidetable, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express*|
|[Member Churn Predictions](https://github.com/shirarua/practicum-projects/tree/main/churn_predictions)|Explored member features and created a model to predict the probability of churn. Used KMeans clustering to further analyze customer behavior. |*Pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, sklearn (model_selection, preprocessing, linear_model, ensemble, metrics, cluster), scipy.cluster.hierachy, sidetable, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express*|
